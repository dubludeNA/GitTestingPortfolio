This project is intended for educational purposes. I am putting into practice the informations I learned in my 5 months workshop on Software Testing, provided by "Software Development Academy".
This project is created mainly through Visual Studio code with code being written locally and then pushed to GitHub.

I'm an easy going person fascinated by two fields apparently totally different at first sight, technology and sports, however they both have a single big common characteristic, they demand change, none of them is satisfied by being stationary. This makes me act and understand that in order to remain relevant and connected to the world I have to learn, experience and put what I gather into practice.

I will post here different exercises to practice:  
    - HTML  
    - CSS  
    - JavaScript  
    - Manual Testing  
    - Automation Testing  
    - Api Testing  
    - Selenium Webdriver  
    - GIT & Visual Studio Code
